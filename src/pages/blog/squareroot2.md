## Why \\(\sqrt{2}\\) is Irrational.


Working towards a [contradiction](https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Definition:Contradiction), we suppose that \\(\sqrt{2}\\) is [rational](https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Definition:Rational_Number). 

So 
$$
\sqrt{2} = \frac{p}{q}
$$
for some \\(p, q \in \mathbb{Z}\\).

Yeah, then we get a contradiction after we see some fun stuff with \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) one being even and the other odd which makes our initial assumption false, thus proving that 
\\(\sqrt{2}\\) is not rational, and thus has to be irrational. 

## Decimal Expansion
 \\(\sqrt{2} \approx 1.4142135623730950488016887242096980785697\\)

## Binary Expansion of \\(\sqrt{2}\\)
 \\(\sqrt{2} \approx 1.011010100000â€¦\\)
